  * Improved the efficiency to save time and reduce costs.
  * Allowed to modify for any enhancements to implement any voting types ( ballet , punch cards and online etc.,) 
  * Provides transparency and an option to include any request breakdowns or summaries that you expect to provide in the final election information.
  * Reporting is flexible and define the exact format and data you require for reporting. Define what type of preliminary counts will be needed and their frequency.
